This is a hacky repository manager, but you've probably gathered that already.

It's a cheap (and remarkably effective) replacement for Artifactory/Nexus/Archiva/whatever when all you want to do is store build artifacts.

I built it for myself, not for others. Therefore if you decide it might be of use to you, then you get to keep both pieces when it breaks.
